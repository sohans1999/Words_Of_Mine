It has been exactly one year and two days since my heart fell apart in many many peaces, it wasn’t beautiful at all. 
I was lying on my bathroom floor for several days and cried and wept out loud. Luckily I’ve had my closest people pulling me of that floor and feeding me some sense. 
Many of you, most of you had no idea. 
I am writing this because I want all of you to know, no matter how hard you’ve been hit by a train of pain..it gets better. But only when you stop running away and accept the pain. 
I know because I ran..so fast. Ive been on a vacation 3 times this summer, oh boy I distracted myself in every possible way. I spent money, I bought pretty fancy things, I rent a house for a month in Turkey, I went to the best parties possible, haha, nothing of that works you guys
So only here, where I have no-one but my family, I am on an island for God sakes, I had no where to run. So I just sat for 4 months near by the Atlantic Ocean, just gazing in to the waves, only me and the Universe. Reading all the possible books of self-growth. And every day intentionally taping into that pain, realizing every inch of it, accepting it. 
And this is it.. now I know, it takes approximately 1 month of no desire to live, 2 months of chaotic anger, 3 months of running and distractions, 4 months of listening to yourself and 2 months to move on forward. Stop running. You wont die. 
And finally there is no more weep in my soul, this WAS a year in my life. Goodbye to that. Amen!
world
